# Version Control, Functions, and Scopes

In this assignment, we'll briefly introduce version control and why it's useful. Additionally, we'll look at functions in Python, and global and local scopes for variables in Python.

## Objectives
* Become familiar with basic version control commands in Git
* Learn about how to define and use functions, including recursive functions 
* Learn about how variables can be scoped globally and locally, and why each case might be useful in the context of user-defined functions

## Git
Before you start the assignment, please make sure that you have

1. Created a Github account
2. Accepted the assignment invitation (ask me to get this URL)


## Functions and Scoping
Please implement all functions in `submission.py`, and make sure that they pass all tests in `tests.py`. To run the tests:

1. Install `pytest` by running `pip install pytest --user`
2. Run tests by running `pytest tests.py`

For implementing the functions, read the documentation to understand what the function should do, and how to go about implementing the functionality.
